                   Socket Library Overview
============================================================

The `socket` library in Python provides low-level networking
interfaces. It allows you to create and manage network
connections using protocols such as TCP (Transmission Control
Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol). This library is
essential for network programming and enables communication
between computers over a network.

### Key Features:
- **Create Sockets**: Establish network connections using 
  `socket.socket()`.
- **Bind and Listen**: Bind to addresses and listen for connections.
- **Connect and Send/Receive Data**: Communicate with other 
  machines using `connect()`, `send()`, and `recv()`.
- **Close Connections**: Release resources with `close()`.
