# 🐍 Python Projects Showcase

This repository is a collection of Python scripts that I’ve developed to practice and showcase fundamental programming concepts. Each project solves a different problem, ranging from basic loops and conditionals to list and string manipulation.

## 📂 Projects Included

- `divisible_sum_pairs.py`: Finds all pairs in a list whose sums are divisible by a given integer.
- `counting_sort.py`: Simple implementation of counting sort.
- `symmetric_difference.py`: Prints the symmetric difference between two sets.
- *(More to come as I learn and grow!)*

## 💡 What I’m Practicing

- Core Python syntax and logic
- Writing clean, modular code
- Algorithmic thinking and problem solving
- Using Git and GitHub for project tracking

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run any script:
```bash
python filename.py
